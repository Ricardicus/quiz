# About

This is a Node.js app made for a quiz-walk at a party. It was made by me and my partner for our 25st birtday party.

# Modify 

The questions are provided in the "quiz.js" file. Feel free to modify them, add more, and 
use this app at your own party! 

# Install

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and launch the app with: 
<pre>
node app.js
</pre>

Edit the variables in app.js:
<pre>
const hostname = 'insert your IP';
const port = 'insert your port';
</pre>

Configure your router, if you are using a NAT router, to [forward all requests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding) to your machine. This is typically done using the router interface after logging in.
